# Interactive Machine Learning Models Blog

This repository contains a static site built with GitHub Pages that explains classic machine learning models through both text and interactive demonstrations.  
The goal is to provide a resource that is clear, historically accurate, mathematically precise, and hands-on.

## Structure

Each article will include:
- History and origin of the model  
- Mathematical foundations and derivations  
- Explanation of how the model learns from data  
- Limitations and cases where the model fails  
- Interactive demonstrations where readers can manipulate inputs, datasets, and parameters to see the model in action  

## Planned Articles and Interactive Demos

- Perceptron (1958) – the first learning algorithm inspired by biological neurons  
- Linear Regression – least squares estimation and residual analysis  
- Logistic Regression – classification with the logit link  
- Decision Trees – recursive partitioning and overfitting control  
- Support Vector Machines – maximum margin classification and kernels  
- Extensions and modern connections as the series progresses  

## Technical Approach

- The site is published through GitHub Pages  
- Articles are written in Markdown and converted to static pages  
- Interactive components are implemented with JavaScript libraries such as D3.js or Plotly  
- All content is fully client-side; no backend is required  

## Access

Once published, the site will be available at:  
`https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to combine explanation and demonstration so that readers can both understand the theory of machine learning models and directly observe their behavior under different conditions.
