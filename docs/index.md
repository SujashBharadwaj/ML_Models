# Interactive Learning of ML_Models

Welcome to **Interactive Learning of ML_Models**, a collection of articles and demonstrations of foundational machine learning models.

The goal of this project is to make machine learning **teachable, rigorous, and interactive**.  
Each model is introduced through:

- Historical background and origin  
- Mathematical formulation  
- How the learning algorithm works  
- Limitations and practical considerations  
- Visualizations and interactive experiments  

---

## Articles

- [Perceptron (1958)](perceptron.md) – the first learning machine  
- [Linear Regression](linear-regression.md) – least squares and residuals  
- (More models coming soon…)

This site is powered by GitHub Pages. All articles and demos live in this repository:
