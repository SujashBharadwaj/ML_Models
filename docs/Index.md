# Interactive Learning of ML_Models

Welcome to **Interactive Learning of ML_Models**, a collection of articles and hands-on demonstrations of foundational machine learning models.  

The goal of this project is to make machine learning **teachable, rigorous, and interactive**.  
Each model is introduced through:  
- Historical background and origin  
- Mathematical formulation  
- How the learning algorithm works  
- Limitations and practical considerations  
- Interactive visualizations you can experiment with directly in your browser  

## Articles

- [Perceptron (1958)](perceptron.md) – the first learning machine  
- [Linear Regression](linear-regression.md) – least squares and residuals  
- (More models coming soon…)
